# $SCAM Meme Coin

$SCAM is a cryptocurrency meme coin created on the Solana blockchain via Pump.

## Description

$SCAM is a sarcastic meme coin whose official communication humorously portrays it as a scam meme coin created by someone so absurdly stupid that they openly reveal their intentions. **In short, $SCAM is the stupidest scam ever.** Below are some catchphrases that capture the spirit of $SCAM:

- "ðŸš€ Rug Pull Certifiedâ„¢"
- "ðŸŽ² Invest. Lose. Laugh. Repeat."
- "100% Guaranteed Scam"
- "Enjoy the ride to zero!"
- "Keep Calm and Get Rug Pulled"
- "Never been Pumped and Dumped before? Enjoy the full experience with $SCAM!"
- "HFSR" (Have Fun Staying Rich)

## Goal

The goal of $SCAM is to build a playful, engaged, and welcoming community. While everyone is welcome to participate and support $SCAM in their own way, it was not created with the intention of enriching the CTO or the community as a whole. This aligns with $SCAM's ethos of honesty and playful irony.

To make it clear, nobody will prevent you from attempting to pump $SCAM's priceâ€”as long as it is done legally. However, price action is not the primary goal of this project.

## CTO Note

I won't reveal who I am for obvious reasons. However, I'll share a few clues (which you may not believe because it's a scam, after all). I'm French, living in Paris, and have been a software engineer for a few years. I've been in and out of crypto since around 2017, like many of us.

$SCAM started as a joke between ex-colleagues. Add a bit too much beer on top of that, and you get a new Pump coin. I got scammed and rug-pulled a few timesâ€”so did they. Pump is the scammerâ€™s paradise. At least this one is honest. That's all there is!

It may seem boring, but I need to add a full honesty point: in France, it's legal to create a Pump coin, but it's illegal to promote it in a way that pushes other people to invest in it. That being said, even if it were legal to do that, **I still wouldn't push anybody to invest in it**. don't expect anybody in the community to own any $SCAM. I know it's difficult to believe, but I don't care about price action or my 3% share in this project. My real investments are in real cryptocurrencies (and there I do care about the price!). That also means that, except for the initial $300 DEX registration, I won't pay for anything else since I personally prefer to avoid jail time ^^.

Final point: **it's not my coin, it's our coin**. I'm just the one who created it and am trying to bootstrap its community. I will only contribute in ways I can and keep a bit of control to prevent illegal or toxic behaviors.
